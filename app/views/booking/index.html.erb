      <h1>Are you losing admission to Harvard because your tutor cannot teach effectively?</h1>
      <p>Your private tutor has an Ivy league degree. <br>
        But are your test scores or English improving as much as they should be?<br>
        Is your progress measured and the lessons designed specifically for you?<br>
        Wouldn’t your chance to attend an elite school be greater if your tutor attended an elite school AND has proven professional experience teaching non-native English speakers?

        Imagine an experienced teacher targeting each component and focusing on your exact weaknesses using proven teaching methods. Each week, we’ll measure your progress and you’ll see proof of rapid improvement in the data.

      <h3>“At first I was uncertain that Eleven Education would be worth the the price...</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve seen cheaper tutors available who offer the same services. After trying one month with Jason, I regret wasting my time with other tutors. Jason’s experience as a teacher shows in his techniques I haven’t seen from other tutors. Jason is the only teacher I’ve seen with a data-driven system of teaching and the strong academic credentials to back it up. Every week, I have proof that I am actually improving! <br><br>
    
        After seeing my improvement, I can only say this: If you aren’t using Jason currently, you should be, because next year he’s going to be twice as expensive!"

      <h3>“Usually I find tutors hit and miss. Often, I don’t learn anything I couldn’t learn myself or don’t learn anything at all...</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes the learning materials is good, but the teacher doesn't explain it in a way that makes sense. Jason really knows what it takes to learn English vocabulary and writing because he is an American-born English speaker and attended a top US university. He explained it in a way that Chinese teacher cannot.
        <br><br>
        Jason didn't just give me the answer, he taught me how to derive it myself. He breaks down everything and guides me through a way of thinking I can use for any problem.
        <br><br>
        I was confident in knowing that if I didn't find the lessons useful, I could get a full refund with no problem."

        I was impressed with how quick Jason responds to my questions. He texts me often to make sure I was doing the work every day and understood the material.<br><br>

        I specifically liked how Jason motivated me to work my hardest. I was happy to study hard because Jason is a positive person that makes me feel happy when I’m studying.<br><br>
